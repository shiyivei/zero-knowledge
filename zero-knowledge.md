## 1.1 Why ZK

1. ZK crypto is more important and general (expecially for arbitrary computing, etc)
2. ZK crypto is easier to use and make contributions (not as difficult as we imagined)
3. ZK crypto is fun and challenging (more potential rewards and creative answers of tough questions)

7. PLONKathon （）

## 1.4 Pre-requisites

1. Number theory and group theory

2. Cryptographic primitives

3. Algebraic concepts,esp,polynomials

## 1.5 ZK Proofs/Protocols

1. concept:  prove sth to someone instead of telling
2. three properties: zk （don't reveal underlying info）; Completeness (can answer anything about underlying info); Soundness （if cheat, will get caught ）

3. examples: digital signature
4. zkps are old: there are some applications and questions
